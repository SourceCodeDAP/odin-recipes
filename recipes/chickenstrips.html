    <caption>Dish: Chicken Strips with Dip</caption>
    <p>Classic finger food which we enjoy with a dipping sauce, such as Comeback Sauce on this site. Sliced, they're also a tasty salad topper. Air fryers do a great job of cooking frozen food, no need to thaw, and this is a perfect weeknight meal, on the table in 12 minutes.</p>
