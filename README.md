# odin-recipes
___Introduction___
This first project is about a recipe page.

Added index.html with a heading on the body and the first recipe. Getting used to the git commands.

-> add and then commit -m <description>

Always thinking about using git often after doing some changes...Added the picture, caption and description of the recipe and I wanted to go further without committing.
